Markdown Content:
State lawmakers are considering a diverse array of AI legislation, with hundreds of bills introduced in 2025.  As described further in this blog post, many of these AI legislative proposals fall into several key categories: (1) comprehensive consumer protection legislation similar to the [Colorado AI Act](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2024a_205_signed.pdf), (2) sector-specific legislation on automated decision-making, (3) chatbot regulation, (4) generative AI transparency requirements, (5) AI data center and energy usage requirements, and (6) frontier model public safety legislation.  Although these categories represent just a subset of current AI legislative activity, they illustrate the major priorities of state legislatures and highlight new AI laws that may be on the horizon.

*   **_Consumer Protection_****.**  Lawmakers in over a dozen states have introduced legislation aimed at reducing algorithmic discrimination in high-risk AI or automated decision-making systems used to make “consequential decisions,” embracing the risk- and role-based approach of the Colorado AI Act.  In general, these frameworks would establish developer and deployer duties of care to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination and would require risks or instances of algorithmic discrimination to be reported to state attorneys general.  They would also require notices to consumers and disclosures to other parties and establish consumer rights related to the AI system.  For example, Virginia’s High-Risk AI Developer & Deployer Act ([HB 2094](https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB2094/text/HB2094S1)), which follows this approach, passed out of Virginia’s legislature this month.

*   **_Sector-Specific Automated Decision-making_****.**  Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced legislation that would regulate the use of AI or automated decision-making tools (“ADMT”) in specific sectors, including healthcare, insurance, employment, and finance.  For example, Massachusetts [HD 3750](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/HD3750/House/Bill/Text) would amend the state’s [health insurance consumer protection law](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter176O/Section6) to require healthcare insurance carriers to disclose the use of AI or ADMT for reviewing insurance claims and report AI and training data information to the Massachusetts Division of Insurance.  Other bills would regulate the use of ADMT in the financial sector, such as New York [A773](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2025/A773), which would require banks that use ADMT for lending decisions to conduct annual disparate impact analyses and disclose such analyses to the New York Attorney General.  Relatedly, state legislatures are considering a wide range of approaches to regulating employers’ uses of AI and ADMT.  For example, Georgia [SB 164](https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20252026/232348) and Illinois [SB 2255](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=2255&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=) would both prohibit employers from using ADMT to set wages unless certain requirements are satisfied.

*   **_Chatbots_****.**  Another key trend in 2025 AI legislation focuses on AI chatbots.  For example, Hawaii [HB 639](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/sessions/session2025/bills/HB639_.HTM) / [SB 640](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/sessions/session2025/bills/SB640_.HTM), Idaho [HB 127](https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2025/legislation/H0127.pdf), Illinois [HB 3021](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=HB&DocNum=3021&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=), Massachusetts [SD 2223](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/SD2223/Senate/Bill/Text), and New York [A222](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2025/A222), would either require chatbot providers to provide prominent disclosures to inform users that they are not interacting with a human or impose liability on chatbot providers for misleading or deceptive chatbot communications.

*   **_Generative AI Transparency_****.**  State legislatures are also considering legislation to regulate providers of generative AI systems and platforms that host synthetic content.  Some of these bills, such as Washington [HB 1170](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1170.pdf?q=20250108131139), Florida [HB 369](https://www.flsenate.gov/session/bill/2025/369/billtext/filed/pdf), Illinois [SB 1929](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=1929&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=), and New Mexico [HB 401](https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/25%20Regular/bills/house/HB0401.html) would require generative AI providers to include watermarks in AI-generated outputs and provide free AI detection tools for users, similar to the [California AI Transparency Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB942), which passed last year.  Other bills, such as Illinois [SB 1792](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=1792&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=) and Utah [SB 226](https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0226.html), would require generative AI owners, licensees, or operators to display notices to users that disclose the use of generative AI or warn users that AI-generated outputs may be inaccurate, inappropriate, or harmful.

*   **_AI Data Centers & Energy_****.**  Lawmakers across the country have introduced legislation to address the growing energy demands of AI development and related environmental concerns.  For example, California [AB 222](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB222) would require data centers to estimate and report to the state the total energy used to develop certain large AI models, and would require covered AI developers to estimate and publish the total energy used to develop each model.  Similarly, Massachusetts [HD 4192](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/HD4192/House/Bill/Text) would require both AI developers and operators of sources of greenhouse gas emissions to monitor, track, and report environmental impacts and mitigations.

*   **_Frontier Model Public Safety_.**  Following the legislature’s passage and Governor’s subsequent veto of California [SB 1047](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047) last year, California State Senator Scott Wiener filed [SB 53](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB53) with the goal of “establish\[ing\] safeguards for the development of \[AI\] frontier models.”  Lawmakers in other states are also considering legislation to address public safety risks posed by “frontier” or “foundation” models, generally defined as AI models that meet certain computational or monetary thresholds.  For example, Illinois [HB 3506c](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=HB&DocNum=3506&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=) would require developers of certain large AI models to conduct risk assessments every 90 days, publish annual third-party audits, and implement foundation model safety and security protocols.  As another approach, Rhode Island [H 5224](https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText25/HouseText25/H5224.pdf) would impose strict liability on developers of covered AI models for all injuries to non-users that are factually and proximately caused by the covered model.

Although the likelihood of passage for these AI bills remains unclear, any state AI legislation that does pass is likely to have significant effects on the U.S. AI regulatory landscape, especially in the absence of federal action on AI.  We will continue to monitor these and related AI developments across our [Inside Global Tech](https://www.insideglobaltech.com/), [Global Policy Watch](https://www.globalpolicywatch.com/), and [Inside Privacy](https://www.insideprivacy.com/) blogs.

As the new year begins, the pace of innovation shows no signs of slowing down. Whether it's the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) that can make decisions autonomously or breakthroughs in sustainable computing, emerging technology trends highlight humanity's relentless pursuit of progress.

While organizations brace for the next wave of disruption, understanding these technologies is crucial to adapt. With a mix of opportunity and responsibility, the technologies of 2025 will shape tomorrow's world, leaving a lasting impact on how people live, work and innovate.

1\. More Companies Will Enable Automated Decision-Making Agents
---------------------------------------------------------------

Smart autonomous AI systems [capable of performing](https://hbr.org/2024/12/what-is-agentic-ai-and-how-will-it-change-work) different procedures and planning those procedures based on specific goals given by the user are expected to transform multiple industries. Today, such AI is hardly being used, however, by 2028, the expectation is that [15%](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-10-21-gartner-identifies-the-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2025) of daily work decisions will be made by agentic AI. I expect this change to increase efficiency and improve processes in many sectors of the economy and society.

2\. Stronger AI Governance Could Reduce Ethical Issues
------------------------------------------------------

While the use of AI is getting more common, I think the goal should be responsible and ethical AI usage. Each AI governance platform's purpose is to develop, implement and enforce regulations for the proper use of artificial intelligence, to explain the process and to gain public confidence.

It is estimated that by 2028, comprehensive AI governance could reduce the number of times organizations experience ethical issues associated with AI by [40%](https://www.cio.com/article/3595801/cios-look-to-sharpen-ai-governance-despite-uncertainties.html) compared to firms without these measures for AI governance.

3\. Multifunctional Robots To Drive Productivity In Key Areas
-------------------------------------------------------------

The future of robotics is in multifunctional robots to perform different functions simultaneously in different settings. The use of smart robots in people's lives is projected to increase from less than 10% now to [80%](https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2024/gartner-s-top-10-tech-trends-of-2025-agentic-ai-robots-and-disinformation-security) by 2030. Such robots could revolutionize productivity and achievement of goals in areas like production, medical and [home care](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00072-z).

4\. Spatial Computing Will Blur Physical And Virtual Boundaries
---------------------------------------------------------------

Spatial computing blurs the division between real and virtual experiences, and the interaction between people and computers. This technology could drive progress in AR and VR, which could impact [education](https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2024/07/what-spatial-computings-future-higher-education) and entertainment, as well as remote collaboration.

Spatial computing use will likely intensify in the coming years, and its market is expected to grow at a rate of [18.2%](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends/2025/tech-trends-future-of-spatial-computing.html) between 2022 and 2033, offering a superior experience and functionality to the user, while increasing operational performance.

6\. Neurological Enhancements Could Expand Human Capabilities
-------------------------------------------------------------

Technology is now allowing neurological enhancements that could improve human cognitive and physical abilities. Applications include healthcare and improving the [performance](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/03/17/ai-and-human-enhancement-americans-openness-is-tempered-by-a-range-of-concerns/) of humans in both fitness and sport, as well as other areas of human endeavor.

As per the data provided by Expert Market Research forecasts, the market is expected to grow from [$156.31 billion](https://www.expertmarketresearch.com/reports/human-augmentation-market) in 2024 to $1,007.23 billion by 2034, at a CAGR of 23%. Moreover, in 2025, I anticipate increased integration of technology into human biology, raising ethical and other issues in society.

7\. Energy-Efficient Computing Will Support Sustainability Goals
----------------------------------------------------------------

Energy-efficient computing is now a major concern for many business leaders, as the environment becomes a [top priority](https://action.deloitte.com/insight/3922/climate-change-climbs-to-top-business-priority-for-boards). Developments in this area often focus on the reduction of energy consumption of data centers and computing devices, contributing to more sustainable technology infrastructures. I expect major strides in the area of sustainable energy-efficient computing in 2025, as aligned with global sustainability goals.

8\. Advanced Tech Will Be Used To Combat Misinformation
-------------------------------------------------------

According to a Gartner study, by 2028, it's predicted that [50%](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/disinformation-security) of enterprises will embrace solutions designed to tackle disinformation security, compared to fewer than 5% in 2024.

9\. Hybrid Computing To Optimize Complex Data Tasks
---------------------------------------------------

10\. Ambient Intelligence Could Anticipate Human Needs
------------------------------------------------------

Ambient invisible intelligence refers to AI systems seamlessly embedded in the environment in ways that lead to better user experience. In 2025, [ambient intelligence](https://wallstreetpublication.com/iot-tendencies-to-watch-in-2025-the-rise-of-ambient-intelligence-and-hyper-customized-ecosystems/) could stand ready to anticipate and respond to a human need without requiring interaction.

The advanced technologies on the horizon represent dynamic new frontiers that will reshape society on an unprecedented scale.

In 2025, I think we'll see AI, computing and other disruptive technologies have a major impact on organizations and their priorities, and also on many adjacent technology domains, such as invisible intelligence.

Nonetheless, as with all great leaps in innovation, comes great responsibility. I think all the industries that approach these trends responsibly could be ahead of the curve and also contribute to creating a better connected, protective and innovative world.

Markdown Content:
Seemingly overnight, several key artificial intelligence (AI) guidance documents from the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and US Department of Labor (DOL) regarding the use of AI in the workplace vanished from the agencies’ websites. These documents were the result of a multiyear effort to provide employers with guidance on how to use AI tools in the employment life cycle without running afoul of employment laws. The removal of these documents followed the new administration’s rollback of President Joe Biden’s executive order and an effective halt being placed on any federal efforts seeking to prioritize “responsible AI” development and deployment. In this alert, we provide an overview of President Donald Trump’s latest executive actions on AI, note the AI-related guidance that has been removed, and outline key implications for employers for the days ahead.

### Trump’s AI executive actions

On inauguration day, Trump immediately [rescinded Biden’s 2023 Executive Order No. 14110 on AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/) (Biden AI order), which had, among other things, directed federal agencies to use regulatory and enforcement tools to address safety, privacy and discrimination concerns related to AI use. Days later, [Trump’s Executive Order No. 14179](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/31/2025-02172/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence) established a policy to “sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance,” and required certain regulators to submit an “action plan” to achieve this policy. Agencies also were ordered to review any “policies, directives, regulations, orders, and other action” enacted under Biden’s AI order and suspend them if inconsistent with the new “AI dominance” policy. A [January 23, 2025, White House fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-action-to-enhance-americas-ai-leadership/) reaffirmed the country’s “leadership in AI” as the top priority, criticizing Biden’s approach as overly restrictive and harmful to innovation.

*   The [May 2023 technical assistance document](https://www.cooley.com/news/insight/2023/2023-06-12-key-principles-from-eeocs-latest-guidance-on-employers-use-of-ai-tools) on AI compliance issues under Title VII, advising employers to assess AI tools for potential adverse impacts on any group protected under Title VII.
*   The May 2022 technical assistance document (and associated “Tips for Workers” document) on potential violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) through AI use, including improper “screen outs” of individuals with disabilities by AI decision-making tools or impermissible inquiries about such disabilities.
*   The December 2024 fact sheet, “Wearables in the Workplace: The Use of Wearables and Other Monitoring Technology Under Federal Employment Discrimination Laws,” which warned that tracking technology embedded in wearable devices (e.g., tracking an employee’s location, heart rate, electrical brain activity or fatigue) could violate the ADA.

Employers should note that the agency’s Strategic Enforcement Plan for Fiscal Years 2024 –2028, which prioritizes regulating employers’ use of technology (including AI and machine learning) through enforcement, remains in effect until a [quorum of commissioners](https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/removing-gender-ideology-and-restoring-eeocs-role-protecting-women-workplace) can modify or revoke it.

*   An April 2024 Field Assistance Bulletin that outlined ways AI use can violate federal employment laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers Act (PUMP Act), and even the Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA).
*   An October 2024 road map of best practices for developers and employers, including AI principles for worker well-being. This document emphasized employers’ use of AI for the benefit of workers and encouraged responsible data use and job protection.

Similarly, the DOL’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP) removed its April 2024 guidance, “Artificial Intelligence and Equal Employment Opportunity for Federal Contractors,” from its website. This guidance alerted federal contractors to compliance obligations for using AI and the need to monitor whether AI and automated systems adversely impact protected groups.

Despite the removal of AI guidance, employers should keep the following in mind:

1.  **Federal, state and local anti-discrimination laws still apply to AI use.**

Employers must still comply with the myriad federal and state anti-discrimination laws governing the use of AI tools in the workplace, including Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and the ADA. These laws prohibit discrimination, which can include not just overt discrimination, but also practices that result in disparate treatment of protected classes or in differing outcomes for protected classes (disparate impact). In addition, the FLSA and other employment laws continue to apply when AI tools are used for employee tracking or monitoring.

Many states and local jurisdictions have enacted more protective anti-discrimination laws and have implemented specific AI regulations. Notably, [Colorado’s SB 24-205](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-205) and [Illinois’ HB 3773](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3773&GAID=17&DocTypeID=HB&SessionID=112&GA=103),  effective in 2026, impose requirements for any AI technology used in the workplace. Colorado’s law (which applies to both developers of AI technologies and employers as “deployers” of such technologies) mandates that reasonable care be taken when using any high-risk AI system to make consequential decisions, which includes those that make or are a substantial factor in making employment decisions. Employers using these systems are required to conduct annual impact assessments and comply with certain transparency obligations designed to protect against algorithmic discrimination. Illinois’ law amends the state’s Human Rights Act to prohibit using AI tools in a way that results in discrimination, which can include using AI tools to exclude applicants from certain zip codes, a practice often referred to as digital redlining. Other jurisdictions, including [New York City](https://www.cooley.com/news/insight/2023/2023-05-15-nyc-issues-final-regulations-on-automated-employment-decision-tools-law) and Maryland, also have enacted AI governance laws impacting employers, which impose audit, transparency and consent requirements for AI use.

The recent executive orders signal a significant policy shift from the previous administration’s focus on “responsible AI” use to the new administration’s “AI dominance” policy. This federal shift to a more pro-innovation approach leaves states and local jurisdictions to fill the regulatory gap. The legislation pipeline is filled with bills seeking to regulate employers’ use of AI tools. Several pending bills would impose audit/notice, policy, reporting and transparency requirements on employers using AI, with significant penalties for noncompliance. While most target algorithmic discrimination, some also address other anticipated impacts from using AI in the workforce, including worker displacement. For example, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed a plan to “support workers displaced by AI,” which includes a directive to the state’s Department of Labor to require businesses submitting notices of worker layoffs to its Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification system to state whether a layoff is related to the business’s use of AI.

Employers must remain vigilant given the proliferation of state and local AI laws.

3.  **Continue your AI compliance programs.**

Given ongoing state and local efforts to regulate AI use, employers should continue to review and strengthen existing compliance programs. It is critical that employers establish processes for maintaining oversight over the AI tools that are implemented. Employees and leadership should be trained on appropriate use of AI technologies in the workplace. Maintaining human oversight of AI use will help to mitigate risk, prevent unintended consequences, and address distrust and employee morale issues stemming from use of (and possibly overreliance on) AI tools.

Employers with questions regarding the use of AI tools should contact their Cooley employment lawyer or one of the lawyers listed below.

Travel companies have been using artificial intelligence for years, but the emergence of generative AI — which gives it the ability to create text, images, audio and video — opened the door wide open to a range of new possibilities.

More than two years later after [the public launch of ChatGPT](https://skift.com/2022/12/05/the-dawn-of-ai-in-travel-and-in-our-daily-lives-suddenly-became-very-real-this-weekend/), the vision is still taking shape. There have been incremental developments, with the industry working to use AI to deliver personalized recommendations, marketing, and customer service. Many of the applications so far are working behind the scenes.

Here's a timeline of the biggest announcements and advances and their impact on travel:

February 2023: Microsoft-Owned Bing Relaunches Around ChatGPT
-------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft's Bing search engine released a chatbot [could simplify how people could search for travel planning on search engines](https://skift.com/2023/02/07/ai-wars-comes-for-travel-planning-as-bing-relaunches-around-chatgpt/). One difference with ChatGPT is the annotations to the sources, and suggestions on further queries.

March 2023: Google Releases Bard
--------------------------------

Google announced that [it would launch Bard](https://skift.com/2023/03/21/google-releases-bard-the-generative-ai-rival-to-chatgpt/), its rival to ChatGPT. Travel Technology Reporter Justin Dawes wrote that it appeared to operate similarly to ChatGPT, except that it responds to prompts with more than one answer.

April 2023: Expedia Releases ChatGPT-Powered AI Chatbot on Mobile App
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Expedia released the first version of a travel planning chatbot on its mobile app, [becoming the first prominent online travel agency in the West to do so](https://skift.com/2023/04/04/expedia-releases-chatgpt-powered-ai-chatbot-on-mobile-app/). (Trip.com, based in Singapore, released a chatbot earlier in 2023.)

Dawes reported Google Search [was getting an update with generative AI from Bard](https://skift.com/2023/05/10/new-google-tools-using-generative-ai-are-relevant-to-travel-sector/), meaning a search prompt for travel could be more detailed upfront. In addition, the top of the results page will incorporate a fuller picture of information, including a shorter answer generated by AI.

June 2023: Priceline Releases New AI Platform and 'Penny' the Chatbot
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A day after sister company Booking.com [unveiled an AI trip planner](https://skift.com/2023/06/27/booking-com-chooses-openai-not-google-bard-for-generative-ai-rollout/) to U.S. members of its Genius travel rewards on its mobile app, Priceline announced it was [launching a series](https://skift.com/2023/06/28/priceline-releases-new-ai-platform-and-penny-the-chatbot/) of 40 new booking and upgrade tools [developed using Google Cloud's Generative AI App Builder](https://skift.com/2023/06/06/priceline-partnering-with-google-on-new-ai-tools/). One of those tools is an AI chatbot named "Penny" that runs across Priceline's entire hotel network and can be used as a local guide, help desk contact, and 24/7 concierge.

Dawes wrote that three big tech companies — Amazon Web Services, Meta, and Microsoft — had recently [made big product releases related to generative AI](https://skift.com/2023/10/12/meta-microsoft-aws-big-tech-reveals-travel-related-ai-projects/).

Amazon Web Services launched Amazon Bedrock, a platform that allows travel companies to build AI tools and apps that access their own proprietary data, which Dawes noted is needed to make a tool useful. Meta released a generative AI chatbot called Meta AI, which uses the company's proprietary generative AI model to answer questions similar to ChatGPT, which Dawes wrote could include questions about planning trips, booking flights, and more.

And Microsoft said it was working with IT company Accenture to pilot a travel assistant in partnership with Amadeus. For example, a user can ask Microsoft 365 Chat to find a flight that matches certain requirements, and the chatbot responds with flight options.

Google said it would [add several new tools designed to help travelers plan trips](https://skift.com/2024/03/27/google-launches-new-ai-travel-tools-whats-new-in-search-and-maps/) and explore destinations. The tech giant also added an experimental AI-based itinerary creation capability to its traditional Search tool for users to opt into. Users could prompt Search for an itinerary for a certain destination, and they would receive flight and hotel options in addition to suggestions for attractions and dining.

May 2024: ChatGPT Is Getting a Major Update
-------------------------------------------

OpenAI unveiled a group of updates that Dawes wrote could result in [travelers having a robotic voice translator in their pocket](https://skift.com/2024/05/13/chatgpt-is-getting-a-major-update-what-it-means-for-travelers/). Upgraded translation capabilities were part of the new GPT-4o model, which OpenAI said is much faster than the previous version and better at interacting with voice, photos, and video.

OpenAI [said in a blog post](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-and-more-tools-to-chatgpt-free/) about the update that a user could now snap a photo of a menu and ask ChatGPT to translate it, as well as provide cultural information about a dish and make recommendations about what to order.

May 2024: Google's Next Step in AI Trip Planning
------------------------------------------------

Google announced that [Gemini Advanced](https://gemini.google.com/advanced?utm_source=gemini&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=gemini_advanced_announce_sh), the paid version of the [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) generative AI chatbot, would be able to build travel itineraries with a simple prompt in easy-to-understand language. Sissie Hsiao, Google's vice president and general manager for Gemini experiences, used a travel example to demonstrate how the chatbot is taking a step closer toward the goal of being a “true AI assistant.”

Hsiao said Gemini Advanced could create a personalized vacation using multiple sources of information for a family planning a weekend trip to Miami, where the user's husband was looking for places to eat fresh seafood.

June 2024: Apple's Siri Gets Better AI
--------------------------------------

Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference that its digital assistant Siri [would soon be able to help users plan trips](https://skift.com/2024/06/10/new-apple-travel-tools-siri-chatgpt-ios-18-vision-pro-vr-headset-apple-watch/). While Dawes wrote that Siri wouldn't be able to perform complicated tasks at that moment such as booking flights, Siri would be able to pull information from across Apple-owned apps.

September 2024: The New iPhone 16 Camera Button Integrates with AI
------------------------------------------------------------------

Apple announced that [the newest iPhones would come with an easy way to ask generative AI about real-life visuals](https://skift.com/2024/09/09/the-new-iphone-16-camera-button-integrates-with-ai-how-it-works-for-travelers/), which would provide travelers with easier ways to navigate new cities. Dawes notes the iPhone16 and iPhone 16 Pro both activate a tool to ask AI about visuals through the camera. For example, when pointing at a restaurant, the iPhone pulls up a window with hours, ratings, and options to view the menu and make a reservation through OpenTable.

October 2024: ChatGPT Advanced Voice: The Future of Travel Booking or the Death of OTAs?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thomas Reiner, a partner at Altimeter Capital, wrote that [ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode could represent the future of travel booking](https://skift.com/2024/10/04/chatgpt-advanced-voice-the-future-of-travel-booking-or-the-death-of-otas/). He provided an example of asking ChatGPT to search for a hotel in Puglia that met specific criteria, and he received tailored answers that he believed would take far longer to piece together manually on Booking or Expedia.

While Reiner wrote that it's uncertain if online travel agencies will adapt or become obsolete in the era of AI, he added that consumers stand to benefit from more personalized, efficient, and even cheaper travel planning provided by AI.

October 2024: Anthropic’s New AI Feature Resembles Human Travel Agents
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), a generative AI startup and competitor to OpenAI, [unveiled an early version of a feature meant to perform computer tasks](https://skift.com/2024/10/23/anthropics-new-ai-feature-mimics-human-travel-agents/) — including making travel plans — the same way a human would. Dawes reported that the new tech showed an early version of how an AI-powered travel agent could operate.

A more advanced version of Anthropic's tech could eliminate the challenges of manually navigating options, comparing prices, and making reservations. Improvements in the technology could drive users to bypass online travel agencies to turn to AI to find better deals.

October 2024: ChatGPT Becomes a Travel Search Engine
----------------------------------------------------

November 2024: Airbnb Says AI Chatbot for Trip Planning Not on the Horizon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dave Stephenson, Airbnb’s chief business officer, said the company’s efforts to incorporate AI in its app [wouldn’t include a chatbot for trip planning](https://skift.com/2024/11/21/airbnbs-ai-plan-no-chatbot-more-personalization/) anytime soon despite working with OpenAI to develop one for users.

January 2025: ChatGPT Can Self-Book Restaurants and Events
----------------------------------------------------------

OpenAI announced that it was releasing [a digital assistant that can complete online searches and purchases for travel, events, restaurants, and more](https://skift.com/2025/01/23/chatgpt-can-now-search-for-and-book-travel-on-its-own/). OpenAI says it has partnered with a number of companies to make sure the tool — known as Operator — can access data from websites, including travel brands Booking.com, Tripadvisor, and Priceline.

January 2025: Emergence of Deep Seek
------------------------------------

[DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/), [a new generative AI model based in China](https://skift.com/2025/01/28/ai-startup-deepseek-has-silicon-valley-panicking-what-it-could-mean-for-travel/), could upend Silicon Valley and the travel industry. The startup's rapid rise — which it says came at a fraction of the cost compared to rivals OpenAI and Google’s Gemini — caused AI stocks to drop. Travel brands working to adopt AI could be big winners in the long run if DeepSeek helps lower the cost of the technology.

**February 2025:** Tripadvisor Gets Boost From Perplexity Partnership
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Tripadvisor [began a trial in January to power some travel-related answers](https://skift.com/2025/01/14/tripadvisor-exec-explains-partnership-with-chatgpt-competitor-perplexity/?utm_source=ask_skift) on the AI search engine Perplexity — a partnership that focuses on sharing Tripadvisor data that’s largely unavailable to third-party search engines, including information about its users' habits. Tripadvisor CEO Matt Goldberg and Chief Financial Officer Mike Noonan both said the following month [the partnership with Perplexity](https://skift.com/2025/02/20/tripadvisors-perplexity-deal-ai-for-customer-acquisition-is-now-a-thing-in-travel/) — [Tripadvisor's first with an AI search engine](https://skift.com/2025/01/14/tripadvisor-exec-explains-partnership-with-chatgpt-competitor-perplexity/?utm_source=ask_skift) — has been a boon for business.

Title: How AI Tools Are Reshaping The SDLC And Impacting Development Processes

URL Source: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/02/21/how-ai-tools-are-reshaping-the-sdlc-and-impacting-development-processes/

We all know that artificial intelligence (AI) is pervasive in many areas of our lives. From the emergence of self-driving vehicles to voice-activated assistants such as Siri & Alexa, AI is reshaping how we lead our lives. But how is this revolution affecting the SDLC (software development life cycle) industry and the development of software, systems and applications on the market? Is AI a factor in their development, and how is it being used?

Let's go back a few years. Early AI-driven coding tools focused primarily on enhancing efficiency in repetitive tasks and reducing human error. This included basic testing and straightforward code generation, focusing on making the developers’ lives easier by reducing the loa of manual labor. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) brought about significant change. Now, AI algorithms can understand and produce human-level text: the basis of turning natural language queries into basic functional code. This reduced the workload on seasoned developers, allowing them to accelerate the more complex elements of the code structure.

Today, AI for software development permeates all aspects of the process, from the initial planning stages, where it predicts project timelines, to testing and, now, even autonomous deployment.

One element that AI is making leaps and bounds in is cybersecurity. It's pretty safe to say that machine learning is the most powerful technology in cybersecurity today. Through machine learning, we can train systems to learn from the data they are exposed to, allowing the computer to make predictions or decisions autonomously. Through this “cognitive” ability, AI is used both offensively and defensively across elements of cybersecurity. In an offensive capacity, AI can detect and react to differences in network traffic, indicating a potential unauthorized access point into a system. With defense, AI can reverse engineer exploits, allowing patches to be available before the exploit becomes public knowledge.

What's To Come
--------------

So, what can the future of integrating AI tools in development hold? The trend of using tools to raise productivity is set to expand dramatically as the providers supply solutions for different programming languages, frameworks and environments. Final testing typically takes between [3 to 6 weeks](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/12/02/software-development-time-estimation-how-long-should-it-take-to-develop-a-product/)—AI tools can dramatically cut that timeframe. Testing and debugging are going to be a clear focus for the future. Furthermore, AI is more pervasive in the project planning and management stages. Here, GitHub Copilot can easily integrate with market-leading project management software, embedded directly into project workflows, allowing it to suggest interceding in the project based on scope and timelines and new developments.

The consensus has been that the AI tools used in development will change the industry beyond recognition, seeing vast swathes of developers and teams with no work, in effect, replaced. If anything from the recent past, that will certainly not be the case in the short term. The tools are designed specifically to augment the development process. By allowing quicker, better lower-level code to be developed by AI, the developer can face more challenging tasks, dedicate more time to them and ultimately produce a better final product quicker.

The Governor’s FY26 Executive Budget includes $90 million in capital funding to substantially increase the computing power of Empire AI, expand access for SUNY researchers, and support the addition of new members including the University of Rochester, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The proposal will be matched by $50 million in private funding from new members and $25 million in SUNY operating funding over ten years. This investment will make the Empire AI supercomputer more powerful, leading to more research for the public good being done faster and more efficiently compared with currently available computing power.

“The United States is in a race with China and the rest of the world in the global AI revolution, and with our first-in-the-nation Empire AI Consortium, New York is leading the way in research and innovation,” **Governor Hochul said.** “With Empire AI, we are setting the standard for harnessing the power of AI for the public good and ultimately creating a better future for New Yorkers.”

Last year, Governor Hochul reached historic agreement with the state legislature as part of the FY25 Budget to establish Empire AI, a first-of-its-kind independent consortium to secure New York’s place at the forefront of artificial intelligence research. The consortium will leverage a $275 million state investment to create and launch a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence computing center on the University at Buffalo’s campus. The center will be used by leading New York institutions to promote responsible research and development, create jobs and advance AI for the public good. The founding members of Empire AI include SUNY, CUNY, Columbia University, Cornell University, New York University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the Flatiron Institute.

In October 2024, only six months after Budget enactment, Governor Hochul launched the first phase of Empire AI thanks to a philanthropic contribution from the Simons Foundation. Housed at the University at Buffalo, the Empire AI Alpha system is operating at maximum capacity and has allowed over 200 researchers across the seven founding members to begin work aimed at addressing major societal challenges.

Researchers are already using Empire AI to conduct groundbreaking research, from medical breakthroughs in treating cancer to making better weather predictions, which will make life better for everyday New Yorkers. Current projects include:

*   Developing technologies that could provide adaptive speech and language therapies to children with special needs.
*   Building models of the climate, which can help communities prepare for future impact of extreme weather events.
*   Building models to help analyze CT scans to better diagnose and treat lung cancer.

Now, Governor Hochul’s proposed expansion will allow Empire AI to secure a future full-scale computing system that supports expanded capacity for SUNY and the addition of new members. The proposed new members of Empire AI consortium include:

*   **University of Rochester,** a leading research university and the largest health care system in Upstate New York, will vastly improve AI-powered medical research and give consortium researchers unparalleled access to medical technologies and information.
*   **Rochester Institute of Technology,** which announced the formation of its Artificial Intelligence Hub last August, has proven to be a nationwide leader developing AI solutions for teaching and learning. By joining the consortium, they are contributing academic and strategic power to Empire AI’s member schools and researchers.
*   **Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,** one of the top medical schools in the country, the first medical school to establish a Department of Artificial Intelligence (the Windreich Department of AI and Human Health) and is ranked as number 1 in AI according to Nature AI Index, has expressed intent to join the Empire AI consortium. The School will work collaboratively with the other healthcare and public health partners to accelerate health AI research with a focus on translation, aimed at improving New York’s health care and public health infrastructure.
*   **SUNY** will double its participation in Empire AI’s consortium, allowing more researchers and students from SUNY’s most research-intensive campuses to access the world-class computing power.

**Expanding Artificial Intelligence Across New York State  
**Access to the computing resources that power AI systems is prohibitively expensive and difficult to obtain. These resources are increasingly concentrated in the hands of large technology companies and other global competitors, who maintain outsized control of the AI development ecosystem. As a result, researchers, public interest organizations, and small companies are being left behind, which has enormous implications for AI safety and society at large. Empire AI is bridging this gap and accelerating the development of AI centered in the public interest for New York State. Enabling this pioneering AI research and development is also helping educational institutions nurture the next generation of talent that will create AI-focused technology startups, driving job growth.

By increasing collaboration between New York State’s world-class research institutions, Empire AI is creating efficiencies of scale not achievable by any single university, empowering and attracting top notch faculty,expanding educational opportunity, and enabling responsible innovation that will significantly strengthen our state’s economy and our national security.The initiative is currently funded by over $400 million in public and private investment, including a $250 million State capital grant investment and $25 million over ten years in SUNY operating funding. The project will also receive more than $125 million from the founding institutions and other private partners, including the Simons Foundation, whose Flatiron Institute works to advance research through computational methods, and Tom Secunda, co-founder of Bloomberg LP and the Secunda Family Foundation, which provides millions of dollars a year in grants to conservation, health care, scientific advancement and other causes.
