Markdown Content:
State lawmakers are considering a diverse array of AI legislation, with hundreds of bills introduced in 2025.  As described further in this blog post, many of these AI legislative proposals fall into several key categories: (1) comprehensive consumer protection legislation similar to the [Colorado AI Act](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2024a_205_signed.pdf), (2) sector-specific legislation on automated decision-making, (3) chatbot regulation, (4) generative AI transparency requirements, (5) AI data center and energy usage requirements, and (6) frontier model public safety legislation.  Although these categories represent just a subset of current AI legislative activity, they illustrate the major priorities of state legislatures and highlight new AI laws that may be on the horizon.

*   **_Consumer Protection_****.**  Lawmakers in over a dozen states have introduced legislation aimed at reducing algorithmic discrimination in high-risk AI or automated decision-making systems used to make “consequential decisions,” embracing the risk- and role-based approach of the Colorado AI Act.  In general, these frameworks would establish developer and deployer duties of care to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination and would require risks or instances of algorithmic discrimination to be reported to state attorneys general.  They would also require notices to consumers and disclosures to other parties and establish consumer rights related to the AI system.  For example, Virginia’s High-Risk AI Developer & Deployer Act ([HB 2094](https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB2094/text/HB2094S1)), which follows this approach, passed out of Virginia’s legislature this month.

*   **_Sector-Specific Automated Decision-making_****.**  Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced legislation that would regulate the use of AI or automated decision-making tools (“ADMT”) in specific sectors, including healthcare, insurance, employment, and finance.  For example, Massachusetts [HD 3750](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/HD3750/House/Bill/Text) would amend the state’s [health insurance consumer protection law](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter176O/Section6) to require healthcare insurance carriers to disclose the use of AI or ADMT for reviewing insurance claims and report AI and training data information to the Massachusetts Division of Insurance.  Other bills would regulate the use of ADMT in the financial sector, such as New York [A773](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2025/A773), which would require banks that use ADMT for lending decisions to conduct annual disparate impact analyses and disclose such analyses to the New York Attorney General.  Relatedly, state legislatures are considering a wide range of approaches to regulating employers’ uses of AI and ADMT.  For example, Georgia [SB 164](https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20252026/232348) and Illinois [SB 2255](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=2255&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=) would both prohibit employers from using ADMT to set wages unless certain requirements are satisfied.

*   **_Chatbots_****.**  Another key trend in 2025 AI legislation focuses on AI chatbots.  For example, Hawaii [HB 639](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/sessions/session2025/bills/HB639_.HTM) / [SB 640](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/sessions/session2025/bills/SB640_.HTM), Idaho [HB 127](https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2025/legislation/H0127.pdf), Illinois [HB 3021](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=HB&DocNum=3021&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=), Massachusetts [SD 2223](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/SD2223/Senate/Bill/Text), and New York [A222](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2025/A222), would either require chatbot providers to provide prominent disclosures to inform users that they are not interacting with a human or impose liability on chatbot providers for misleading or deceptive chatbot communications.

*   **_Generative AI Transparency_****.**  State legislatures are also considering legislation to regulate providers of generative AI systems and platforms that host synthetic content.  Some of these bills, such as Washington [HB 1170](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1170.pdf?q=20250108131139), Florida [HB 369](https://www.flsenate.gov/session/bill/2025/369/billtext/filed/pdf), Illinois [SB 1929](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=1929&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=), and New Mexico [HB 401](https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/25%20Regular/bills/house/HB0401.html) would require generative AI providers to include watermarks in AI-generated outputs and provide free AI detection tools for users, similar to the [California AI Transparency Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB942), which passed last year.  Other bills, such as Illinois [SB 1792](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=1792&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=) and Utah [SB 226](https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0226.html), would require generative AI owners, licensees, or operators to display notices to users that disclose the use of generative AI or warn users that AI-generated outputs may be inaccurate, inappropriate, or harmful.

*   **_AI Data Centers & Energy_****.**  Lawmakers across the country have introduced legislation to address the growing energy demands of AI development and related environmental concerns.  For example, California [AB 222](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB222) would require data centers to estimate and report to the state the total energy used to develop certain large AI models, and would require covered AI developers to estimate and publish the total energy used to develop each model.  Similarly, Massachusetts [HD 4192](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/HD4192/House/Bill/Text) would require both AI developers and operators of sources of greenhouse gas emissions to monitor, track, and report environmental impacts and mitigations.

*   **_Frontier Model Public Safety_.**  Following the legislature’s passage and Governor’s subsequent veto of California [SB 1047](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047) last year, California State Senator Scott Wiener filed [SB 53](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB53) with the goal of “establish\[ing\] safeguards for the development of \[AI\] frontier models.”  Lawmakers in other states are also considering legislation to address public safety risks posed by “frontier” or “foundation” models, generally defined as AI models that meet certain computational or monetary thresholds.  For example, Illinois [HB 3506c](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&SessionId=114&GA=104&DocTypeId=HB&DocNum=3506&GAID=18&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session=) would require developers of certain large AI models to conduct risk assessments every 90 days, publish annual third-party audits, and implement foundation model safety and security protocols.  As another approach, Rhode Island [H 5224](https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText25/HouseText25/H5224.pdf) would impose strict liability on developers of covered AI models for all injuries to non-users that are factually and proximately caused by the covered model.

Although the likelihood of passage for these AI bills remains unclear, any state AI legislation that does pass is likely to have significant effects on the U.S. AI regulatory landscape, especially in the absence of federal action on AI.  We will continue to monitor these and related AI developments across our [Inside Global Tech](https://www.insideglobaltech.com/), [Global Policy Watch](https://www.globalpolicywatch.com/), and [Inside Privacy](https://www.insideprivacy.com/) blogs.

_AI Infrastructure and Startup Investments Continue to Surge_

In a joint venture with Oracle, OpenAI, and Softbank, President Trump announced a new project called Stargate. The initiative will invest an initial $100 billion in domestic AI infrastructure and up to $500 billion over the next four years to help support U.S. re-industrialization and strengthen national security for America and its allies. Already underway is a 1 million square-foot data center construction project in Texas. Oracle and OpenAI, along with Arm, Microsoft, and Nvidia, will be the key initial tech partners of the project. Softbank Masayoshi Son will serve as the chairman.1 On fundraising, OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $40 billion, potentially valuing the company at $340 billion. This valuation would nearly double OpenAI’s October 2024 valuation and position it as the world’s second-most valuable startup after SpaceX. SoftBank is expected to lead the funding round with an investment of $15–25 billion, which would make it OpenAI’s largest investor, surpassing Microsoft.2

_The Physical AI Era Is Here_

At the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia introduced two new technologies that we believe have the potential to expedite the development of robotics and autonomous driving. First, Nvidia introduced its open model license Cosmos platform for developing physical AI systems. Cosmos uses world foundation models (WFMs) to generate photo-realistic video for training physical AI systems like self-driving cars and humanoid robots at lower costs than traditional data collection methods, such as real-world driving. The synthetic training data that these models produce allows machines to understand the physical world, like how large language models (LLMs) enable chatbots to communicate naturally.9 Nvidia also debuted its Isaac GROOT Blueprint, a software tool for training humanoid robots. Developers can record specific movements that the software synthesizes into a broader range of actions, enabling robots to learn more efficiently.10 In our view, both new technologies can help alleviate the bottleneck of limited data for robotic and self-driving applications.

Title: AI Developments in Travel: Skift Timeline

URL Source: https://skift.com/2025/02/21/ai-developments-in-travel-skift-timeline/

Published Time: 2025-02-21T15:17:53Z

Markdown Content:
Travel companies have been using artificial intelligence for years, but the emergence of generative AI — which gives it the ability to create text, images, audio and video — opened the door wide open to a range of new possibilities.

More than two years later after [the public launch of ChatGPT](https://skift.com/2022/12/05/the-dawn-of-ai-in-travel-and-in-our-daily-lives-suddenly-became-very-real-this-weekend/), the vision is still taking shape. There have been incremental developments, with the industry working to use AI to deliver personalized recommendations, marketing, and customer service. Many of the applications so far are working behind the scenes.

Here's a timeline of the biggest announcements and advances and their impact on travel:

February 2023: Microsoft-Owned Bing Relaunches Around ChatGPT
-------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft's Bing search engine released a chatbot [could simplify how people could search for travel planning on search engines](https://skift.com/2023/02/07/ai-wars-comes-for-travel-planning-as-bing-relaunches-around-chatgpt/). One difference with ChatGPT is the annotations to the sources, and suggestions on further queries.

March 2023: Google Releases Bard
--------------------------------

Google announced that [it would launch Bard](https://skift.com/2023/03/21/google-releases-bard-the-generative-ai-rival-to-chatgpt/), its rival to ChatGPT. Travel Technology Reporter Justin Dawes wrote that it appeared to operate similarly to ChatGPT, except that it responds to prompts with more than one answer.

April 2023: Expedia Releases ChatGPT-Powered AI Chatbot on Mobile App
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Expedia released the first version of a travel planning chatbot on its mobile app, [becoming the first prominent online travel agency in the West to do so](https://skift.com/2023/04/04/expedia-releases-chatgpt-powered-ai-chatbot-on-mobile-app/). (Trip.com, based in Singapore, released a chatbot earlier in 2023.)

Dawes reported Google Search [was getting an update with generative AI from Bard](https://skift.com/2023/05/10/new-google-tools-using-generative-ai-are-relevant-to-travel-sector/), meaning a search prompt for travel could be more detailed upfront. In addition, the top of the results page will incorporate a fuller picture of information, including a shorter answer generated by AI.

June 2023: Priceline Releases New AI Platform and 'Penny' the Chatbot
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A day after sister company Booking.com [unveiled an AI trip planner](https://skift.com/2023/06/27/booking-com-chooses-openai-not-google-bard-for-generative-ai-rollout/) to U.S. members of its Genius travel rewards on its mobile app, Priceline announced it was [launching a series](https://skift.com/2023/06/28/priceline-releases-new-ai-platform-and-penny-the-chatbot/) of 40 new booking and upgrade tools [developed using Google Cloud's Generative AI App Builder](https://skift.com/2023/06/06/priceline-partnering-with-google-on-new-ai-tools/). One of those tools is an AI chatbot named "Penny" that runs across Priceline's entire hotel network and can be used as a local guide, help desk contact, and 24/7 concierge.

Dawes wrote that three big tech companies — Amazon Web Services, Meta, and Microsoft — had recently [made big product releases related to generative AI](https://skift.com/2023/10/12/meta-microsoft-aws-big-tech-reveals-travel-related-ai-projects/).

Amazon Web Services launched Amazon Bedrock, a platform that allows travel companies to build AI tools and apps that access their own proprietary data, which Dawes noted is needed to make a tool useful. Meta released a generative AI chatbot called Meta AI, which uses the company's proprietary generative AI model to answer questions similar to ChatGPT, which Dawes wrote could include questions about planning trips, booking flights, and more.

And Microsoft said it was working with IT company Accenture to pilot a travel assistant in partnership with Amadeus. For example, a user can ask Microsoft 365 Chat to find a flight that matches certain requirements, and the chatbot responds with flight options.

Google said it would [add several new tools designed to help travelers plan trips](https://skift.com/2024/03/27/google-launches-new-ai-travel-tools-whats-new-in-search-and-maps/) and explore destinations. The tech giant also added an experimental AI-based itinerary creation capability to its traditional Search tool for users to opt into. Users could prompt Search for an itinerary for a certain destination, and they would receive flight and hotel options in addition to suggestions for attractions and dining.

May 2024: ChatGPT Is Getting a Major Update
-------------------------------------------

OpenAI unveiled a group of updates that Dawes wrote could result in [travelers having a robotic voice translator in their pocket](https://skift.com/2024/05/13/chatgpt-is-getting-a-major-update-what-it-means-for-travelers/). Upgraded translation capabilities were part of the new GPT-4o model, which OpenAI said is much faster than the previous version and better at interacting with voice, photos, and video.

OpenAI [said in a blog post](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-and-more-tools-to-chatgpt-free/) about the update that a user could now snap a photo of a menu and ask ChatGPT to translate it, as well as provide cultural information about a dish and make recommendations about what to order.

May 2024: Google's Next Step in AI Trip Planning
------------------------------------------------

Google announced that [Gemini Advanced](https://gemini.google.com/advanced?utm_source=gemini&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=gemini_advanced_announce_sh), the paid version of the [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) generative AI chatbot, would be able to build travel itineraries with a simple prompt in easy-to-understand language. Sissie Hsiao, Google's vice president and general manager for Gemini experiences, used a travel example to demonstrate how the chatbot is taking a step closer toward the goal of being a “true AI assistant.”

Hsiao said Gemini Advanced could create a personalized vacation using multiple sources of information for a family planning a weekend trip to Miami, where the user's husband was looking for places to eat fresh seafood.

June 2024: Apple's Siri Gets Better AI
--------------------------------------

Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference that its digital assistant Siri [would soon be able to help users plan trips](https://skift.com/2024/06/10/new-apple-travel-tools-siri-chatgpt-ios-18-vision-pro-vr-headset-apple-watch/). While Dawes wrote that Siri wouldn't be able to perform complicated tasks at that moment such as booking flights, Siri would be able to pull information from across Apple-owned apps.

September 2024: The New iPhone 16 Camera Button Integrates with AI
------------------------------------------------------------------

Apple announced that [the newest iPhones would come with an easy way to ask generative AI about real-life visuals](https://skift.com/2024/09/09/the-new-iphone-16-camera-button-integrates-with-ai-how-it-works-for-travelers/), which would provide travelers with easier ways to navigate new cities. Dawes notes the iPhone16 and iPhone 16 Pro both activate a tool to ask AI about visuals through the camera. For example, when pointing at a restaurant, the iPhone pulls up a window with hours, ratings, and options to view the menu and make a reservation through OpenTable.

October 2024: ChatGPT Advanced Voice: The Future of Travel Booking or the Death of OTAs?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thomas Reiner, a partner at Altimeter Capital, wrote that [ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode could represent the future of travel booking](https://skift.com/2024/10/04/chatgpt-advanced-voice-the-future-of-travel-booking-or-the-death-of-otas/). He provided an example of asking ChatGPT to search for a hotel in Puglia that met specific criteria, and he received tailored answers that he believed would take far longer to piece together manually on Booking or Expedia.

While Reiner wrote that it's uncertain if online travel agencies will adapt or become obsolete in the era of AI, he added that consumers stand to benefit from more personalized, efficient, and even cheaper travel planning provided by AI.

October 2024: Anthropic’s New AI Feature Resembles Human Travel Agents
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), a generative AI startup and competitor to OpenAI, [unveiled an early version of a feature meant to perform computer tasks](https://skift.com/2024/10/23/anthropics-new-ai-feature-mimics-human-travel-agents/) — including making travel plans — the same way a human would. Dawes reported that the new tech showed an early version of how an AI-powered travel agent could operate.

A more advanced version of Anthropic's tech could eliminate the challenges of manually navigating options, comparing prices, and making reservations. Improvements in the technology could drive users to bypass online travel agencies to turn to AI to find better deals.

October 2024: ChatGPT Becomes a Travel Search Engine
----------------------------------------------------

November 2024: Airbnb Says AI Chatbot for Trip Planning Not on the Horizon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dave Stephenson, Airbnb’s chief business officer, said the company’s efforts to incorporate AI in its app [wouldn’t include a chatbot for trip planning](https://skift.com/2024/11/21/airbnbs-ai-plan-no-chatbot-more-personalization/) anytime soon despite working with OpenAI to develop one for users.

January 2025: ChatGPT Can Self-Book Restaurants and Events
----------------------------------------------------------

OpenAI announced that it was releasing [a digital assistant that can complete online searches and purchases for travel, events, restaurants, and more](https://skift.com/2025/01/23/chatgpt-can-now-search-for-and-book-travel-on-its-own/). OpenAI says it has partnered with a number of companies to make sure the tool — known as Operator — can access data from websites, including travel brands Booking.com, Tripadvisor, and Priceline.

January 2025: Emergence of Deep Seek
------------------------------------

[DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/), [a new generative AI model based in China](https://skift.com/2025/01/28/ai-startup-deepseek-has-silicon-valley-panicking-what-it-could-mean-for-travel/), could upend Silicon Valley and the travel industry. The startup's rapid rise — which it says came at a fraction of the cost compared to rivals OpenAI and Google’s Gemini — caused AI stocks to drop. Travel brands working to adopt AI could be big winners in the long run if DeepSeek helps lower the cost of the technology.

**February 2025:** Tripadvisor Gets Boost From Perplexity Partnership
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Tripadvisor [began a trial in January to power some travel-related answers](https://skift.com/2025/01/14/tripadvisor-exec-explains-partnership-with-chatgpt-competitor-perplexity/?utm_source=ask_skift) on the AI search engine Perplexity — a partnership that focuses on sharing Tripadvisor data that’s largely unavailable to third-party search engines, including information about its users' habits. Tripadvisor CEO Matt Goldberg and Chief Financial Officer Mike Noonan both said the following month [the partnership with Perplexity](https://skift.com/2025/02/20/tripadvisors-perplexity-deal-ai-for-customer-acquisition-is-now-a-thing-in-travel/) — [Tripadvisor's first with an AI search engine](https://skift.com/2025/01/14/tripadvisor-exec-explains-partnership-with-chatgpt-competitor-perplexity/?utm_source=ask_skift) — has been a boon for business.

AI agents are reshaping industries, with some adopting them faster than others. The cryptocurrency sector is at the forefront, embracing automated decision-making, advanced data analysis, and greater efficiency in handling vast amounts of data. These AI technologies are becoming essential for traders, investors, and blockchain companies.

The AI agent market [reached](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-agents-market-15761548.html) $5 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $47 billion by 2030. As Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, predicted during his presentation at CES 2025, "AI agents are a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity." One platform that facilitate the creation and deployment of AI agents, Olas, for instance, is already [processing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/02/06/three-ai-agents-built-on-blockchain-to-transform-crypto-defi-gaming/) over 700,000 transactions monthly, with adoption rates climbing 30% month over month.

This growth is further accelerated by the emergence of DeFAI, a fusion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and AI agents, which is set to redefine the crypto landscape. Businesses and investors who adapt to these tools will gain an edge in a data-driven market.

The Convergence Of AI And DeFi
------------------------------

DeFAI represents the integration of AI agents into DeFi platforms, automating and optimizing on-chain activities such as staking, swapping, auto-compounding, and investing across chains. DeFAI agents act as intelligent assistants equipped with wallet access, guiding users through complex DeFi operations and streamlining processes. By simplifying these tasks, DeFAI is making decentralized finance more accessible to both new users and experienced investors.

Examples of such agents include Superform — a platform that leverages AI to simplify yield farming and portfolio rebalancing across multiple chains. Another example is AI-driven treasury management systems, where autonomous agents allocate funds across different DeFi protocols, optimize liquidity pools, adjust collateral ratios in lending platforms, and maximize yield strategies based on real-time market conditions.

**Autonomous Trading, Mindshare, And Sentiment Analysis**
---------------------------------------------------------

AI agents enhance crypto trading through rapid trade execution in milliseconds alongside market trend analysis while reducing human involvement to minimum levels. Large language models are used by platforms like Kaito AI to aggregate and analyze crypto data from multiple sources to deliver real-time insights. Projects like AI16Z, with a [market cap of $579 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ai16z/) as of February 2025, demonstrate how artificial intelligence is being integrated into trading solutions to enhance efficiency and decision-making.

The use of both mindshare (brand awareness and prominence in the market) and sentiment analysis is becoming a crucial part of trading as well. By using social sentiment from platforms like X and Reddit, and social intelligence tools, such as LunarCrush, autonomous trading bots can predict market movements and turn data into actionable real-time trading insights.

**Tokenization Of AI Agents**
-----------------------------

Decentralized platform [Virtuals Protocol](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/assets/virtuals-protocol-virtual/) is leading the way by enabling users to create and co-own AI agents as digital assets. This approach allows for fractional ownership and revenue sharing, paving the way for investment and engagement in the AI-crypto ecosystem. Several AI agent coins are now available, including Virtuals Protocol’s AIXBT token, which has shown steady adoption since its launch in 2024.

Tokenized agents change the way users interact with AI systems by allowing them to benefit from an agent’s success or performance. This model both democratizes access to advanced technology and encourages collaboration between developers and investors.

**Enhanced Risk Assessment And Security**
-----------------------------------------

AI agents analyze market data, identify fraudulent activities, and provide more accurate predictions boosting risk management protocols. As security concerns remain paramount in crypto adoption, these capabilities make AI agents a key tool for safeguarding assets. For example, [Griffin AI’s Price Analyst](https://chainwire.org/2025/01/21/new-ai-agents-transform-crypto-market-analysis/), an autonomous agent launched in January, delivers real-time insights across over 2,000 cryptocurrencies. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of blockchain data, identifying unusual patterns that may indicate fraud or potential market manipulation. By continuously monitoring transactions and market trends, this AI agent aims to help traders make informed decisions while mitigating risks associated with scams or hacks.

Managing assets across multiple chains is one of the biggest challenges in DeFi. To solve this, AI agents are providing unified dashboards that aggregate crypto holdings from chains like Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and others. These tools simplify portfolio management while offering real-time insights into asset performance across ecosystems. For example, CYBRO is an AI-powered multichain earn marketplace that offers access to top crypto investment options with automated portfolio management.

The trend of integrating crypto assets into traditional portfolio management systems is also growing. In 2022, BlackRock’s Aladdin, a leading investment management platform, [teamed up](https://www.coinbase.com/en-nl/blog/coinbase-selected-by-blackrock-provide-aladdin-clients-access-to-crypto-trading-and-custody-via) with Coinbase to offer institutional clients access to crypto trading and custody services. Aladdin Copilot, an AI-powered assistant utilizing generative AI, now provides immediate insights, answers questions, and automates tasks on BlackRock’s platform.

AI agents are transforming the industry by tackling key challenges in the crypto space, enhancing market efficiency through autonomous trading and risk assessment, providing easier access to tools via tokenization and natural language interfaces, and improving the overall user experience.

The large valuations of pioneering projects underscore the growing demand for these technologies—and this is just the beginning. By making complex DeFi operations more accessible while improving scalability and security across blockchain ecosystems, AI agents are here to stay, reshaping companies like never before.

Match Group, owner of Tinder and Hinge, is using AI to help curb bad behaviour on its dating platforms, reports the [Financial Times](https://app.now.fticonsulting.com/e/er?s=2064197708&lid=193749&elqTrackId=d9a3fccc0cd04cde9266a1fa9cb14c89&elq=829c8ba34d6648d5950d8d9131256ad7&elqaid=56748&elqat=1&elqak=8AF566D523118ABC00E1AC60CF7902C64112225885AAA4D4CA33CA6BC40CEE7F46AC "https://app.now.fticonsulting.com/e/er?s=2064197708&lid=193749&elqTrackId=d9a3fccc0cd04cde9266a1fa9cb14c89&elq=829c8ba34d6648d5950d8d9131256ad7&elqaid=56748&elqat=1&elqak=8AF566D523118ABC00E1AC60CF7902C64112225885AAA4D4CA33CA6BC40CEE7F46AC"). AI detects potentially abusive or overly sexual messages and produces a prompt asking users if they’re sure they want to send the message. 20% of users reconsider their messages after the prompt. The move comes as dating apps like Tinder face a dip in users amid “dating app fatigue” among Gen Z. In response, Match is rolling out fresh features to make dating safer and more respectful. Yoel Roth, Match’s safety chief and former Twitter head, is also tackling the rise of romance scams, but warns that human scammers, not AI bots, remain the real threat.

Despite the noise from some political figures last week, regulatory issues are not his primary concern. Instead, Midha points to the inaction of European CEOs and executives in embracing AI-driven productivity enhancements. While US companies have aggressively partnered with AI startups, European enterprises lag behind, which Midha attributes to cultural inertia.
